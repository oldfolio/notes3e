<h1>Miscellaneous Email Notes</h1>
<p>NOTE: Be sure to see also the DNS notes that are relevant
to setting up email hosting (MX, SPF, etc.).</p>
<h2>Alpine</h2>
<pre>
Search all messages in a folder:

; t a [search string]
; = select
t = text
a = all fields

Command line options:

alpine -p [/path/to/alternate-pinerc] -passfile [/path/to/password-file]

When creating a password file, Alpine no longer behaves the way it did
in the free and easy old days when you could create a passfile with
simply

touch password-file

Now, after creating a new empty file (with "touch" as above), you need
to open the file with an editor and insert a line return. After saving
the passfile with the line return in it, Alpine should then prompt you
to create a master password to encrypt the passfile the next time
Alpine needs to access the passfile.

Common server strings:

{smtp.fastmail.com:465/ssl/user=user@fastmail.com/novalidate-cert}
{imap.fastmail.com:993/ssl/user=user@fastmail.com/novalidate-cert}
{imap.gmail.com:993/ssl/user=user@gmail.com/novalidate-cert}[Gmail]/All Mail

If you wish to start Alpine with a remote pinerc, add the following
argument at the command line:

alpine -p {imap.gmail.com:993/ssl/user=user@gmail.com/novalidate-cert}pinerc-sdf-pine

Some settings you might want to tweak:

deadletter
enable alternate editor command
  [allows you to use ^_ to invoke an editor other than alpine's default]

sigdashes

header in reply
text in reply

disable-sender / do not generate sender header
mark fcc seen
blank fcc
blank subject
dot-folders / hidden folders
convert dates to localtime
x-x-sender

index-format STATUS MSGNO DATE FROMORTO KSIZE SUBJECT
     [The default when this field is undefined is same as above
     except that the default uses SIZE instead of KSIZE.]
enable aggregate
enable flag
enable full header command
expose hidden config
sort-key = Date or Reverse Date

Default Composer Headers
	From:
	To:
	Cc:
	Fcc:
	Subject:
	Attchmnt:

customized-hdrs / Customized Headers = From: Full Name <user@domain.com>

editor = emacs [or vim]
  [The editor invoked by the ^_ (alternate editor command)]

DELETE FILTER

When a message is expunged, this filter moves it to a designated
folder (i.e. Trash). The message is only fully removed when it is
expunged from the designated folder. You probably do not want to
use this filter with Gmail. If you use Gmail, then moving a message
to the [Gmail]/Trash folder will remove it from all other locations,
and when expunged from [Gmail]/Trash the message is gone forever.

S(etup) -- R(ules) -- F(ilters)

Nickname: Move Deleted to Trash
Current Folder Type = Email
Message is Deleted? = Yes
Filter Action = Move (then select folder)

For IMAP Collections:	
    separate-folder-and-directory-entries
    quell-empty-directories
    You might also need: enable-lame-list-mode / deficient imap servers

Odd characters show up in the body of messages:

This can be caused by a character-encoding mismatch between your terminal
and alpine. Make sure both are set to utf-8.
